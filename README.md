# Optimizing-and-Forecasting-the-Amount-of-Biodiesel-Stock-Distribution-Availability-In-Indonesia
The project aims to find out whether the stock distribution availability in Indonesia so that it will be able to meet the needs of both domestic (including its demand, production, and forecast) and global export markets.

The Problem:
The availability of biodiesel stock in Indonesia faces several problems, especially with increasing demand both domestically and for global export. Here are some examples of problems that may arise such as the following:
1. Limited Production: Although Indonesia is one of the main producers of biodiesel, production capacity is often not enough to meet increasing demand. Factors such as bad weather, pest attacks, or problems in the raw material supply chain can disrupt production.
2. Distribution Infrastructure: Rising demand requires adequate distribution infrastructure to deliver biodiesel products to consumers, both domestically and internationally. Infrastructure limitations can hinder supply efficiency.
3. Regulation and Policy: Changing government policies on biodiesel, including export subsidies and tariffs, can create uncertainty in the market, affecting investment and production planning.

Purpose of The Model:
1. The main purpose of the model is to find out whether the stock distribution availability in Indonesia will be able to meet the needs of both domestic and global export markets.
2. To identify the growth in demand for biodiesel exports to the global market as an influencing factor in the stock distribution availability in Indonesia.
3. To analyse the product quality, and affordable price average rate for both industrial and retail as an important variable in increasing increasing domestic demand in Indonesia.
4. To analyse the influence of the use of the latest technology average rate as an important variable in increasing domestic biodiesel production in Indonesia.
5. To analyse the availability of facilities, and infrastructure development average rate as an important variable in increasing biodiesel distribution to stock in Indonesia.

So, addressing these issues requires collaboration between government, industry, and other stakeholders to ensure a sustainable supply of biodiesel amidst rising demand.
